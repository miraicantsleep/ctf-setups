# Ansible playbook setup for CTF-s

## Introduction
This playbook is intended to be used on a fresh Linux installation. This playbook mostly focuses on binary exploitation and reverse engineering tools, but also includes some other tools that are useful in CTF-s.

> **Note:** This playbook is intended to be used on a fresh Linux installation. It may not work as intended on a system that already has some of the tools installed.

> **Another Note:** Also, this playbook was created because at the time of writing, i just broke my Linux installation ðŸ’€
